    "Two sorted lists of records of the form [key, value] can be merged into a single, sorted list by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- iterating through the larger of the two sorted lists.\n",
    "    - comparing the first (assumed smallest) element of the smaller list to the first (assumed smallest) element of the larger list\n",
    "    - popping the smallest of the elements from the above comparison and placing it at the bottom of a new list to hold the single merged list\n",
    "    - the above is repeated until one of the two lists is empty\n",
    "    - finally, the remainding list is appended to the bottom of the single merged list (because itself is sorted)\n",
    "\n",
    "This sorting technique is used in the shuffle phase of Hadoop MapReduce: the shuffle occurs after the mappers have output the intermediate key value records, but before these intermediate records are passed to the reducers. Specifically, after the mapper tasks have been executed, the intermediate records are written to memory (and later to disk if there is enough data), the records are then partitioned based on their keys, and then mergesorted."

    "__ANSWER:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Hadoop, a combiner function is a function that aggregates intermediate results from mapper tasks before these are fed to reducer tasks downstream in the MapReduce framework of Hadoop. The Hadoop MapReduce framework reserves the right to use combiners (or not) at its discretion regardless of the instructions presented by the programmer to the framework. As such, it is critical that the combiner functions not only ingest intermediate records in the same format as those fed to the reducers downstream, but they must also produce aggregated intermediate records that are identical in format to the un-aggregated records output by the mapper tasks upstream. As a sort of 'mini reducers', combiners are meant to accomplish the important tasks of (1) minimizing the number of key-value pairs that are  shuffled across the network from the mappers to the reducers and (2) reducing the risk of reducer tasks 'lagging' due to aggregating across keys that have a very large list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when combiners can (and should) be used is the simple word count exercise! Combiners should be used in word count to achieve tasks (1) and (2) mentioned above. Particularly, the frequency of words varies widely in a corpus; in an English corpus, the token \"the\" is likely to be encountered a very large number of times and considerably more times than many other tokens in the corpus. As such the reducer assigned to aggregate the counts for the token will likely lag behind other reducers processing rarer tokens; furthermore, there will be a very large number of \"the\\t1\" intermediate records that will be shuffled across the network. Combiner tasks will critically reduce the amount of work that the reducers assigned to process common tokens (such as \"the\") will need to do while also minimizing the amount of data that is shuffled across the network (e.g. shuffling \"the\\tN\" intermediate records as opposed to \"the\\t1\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is important to note that the word count example (and any larger task that uses combiners for that matter) can be resolved (abeit consuming more resources) without the use of combiners."
